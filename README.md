# Project-362
Bundled ETP Wastewater Recycling by SIIPL, Pune, India

The project activity is pre-approved under the UCR RoU program for the following scope:
• Scope 5 (Conservation measures taken to recycle and/or reuse water, spent wash,
wastewater etc across or within specific industrial processes and systems, including
wastewater recycled/ reused in a different process, but within the same site or location of
the project activity. Recycled wastewater used in off-site landscaping, gardening or tree
plantations/forests activity are also eligible under this Scope.)
_______________
The project activity recycles wastewater from 2 (two) ETPs and reuses the same for captive gainful
industrial use (e.g., cooling towers, boilers and gardening purposes). The wastewater from both
ETPs are further purified to generate water quality equivalent to safe drinking water standards and
complies with all national and international standards like USEPA/WHO/BIS-10500.

In the absence of the project activity, the PP would have installed bore wells that would have
depleted the local groundwater resources and/or continued to use existing drinking water
resources in the surrounding area and/or discharged the ETP effluent without recycling the same
for gainful captive purposes.
_______________
The project activity achieves the following key water and sanitation related Sustainable
Development Goals under the United Nation (UN-SDGDs):

1 – SDG 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere
